For this project I have decided to create a weather SPA to display the weather for the given coordinates. Originally, I wanted to impliment a search bar that allows the user to enter their zip code, however I learned the restrictions of the API would not allow me to do so with my current knowledge. However in this project, it allows me to plug in the longitude and latitude for any place in the world and it will fetch the data from the weather API to diaplay the chosen information in a format that I would be able to use on a daily basis. I have added three event listeners in order to make the SPA more engaging for the user. The biggest obstacle I ran into was figuring out the logic to pull the arrar for the most recent/future hours from the public API.
